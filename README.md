# Summary

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/l3x/trybechatter/blob/master/trybe-chatter-components.png">

Nested components in React.js help us create more complex view element structures and decided to build a React.js demo app based on composition of UI components.

Hereâ€™s the component hierarchy:

```
App
+ RoomList
  + Room
+ RoomForm
+ MessageList
  + Message
```
